It looks like I'm currently unable to generate the images directly. However, I can guide you on how to visualize the UI for each aspect of your application, considering a UI strategist's perspective. Here's how you can sketch it out:

1. Primary Dashboard Layout
Header Section:

Position: At the top of the screen, spanning the width of the application.
Tabs: Horizontal tabs for "Dashboard," "Backtesting," "Reports," "Assets," and "Settings." Each tab should be clearly labeled and separated with a slight space, making them easily clickable.
Color Scheme: The header should have a slightly darker background than the rest of the UI, with contrasting white or light-colored text for the tabs.
Asset Management Panel:

Location: On the left side of the screen, taking up about one-third of the width.
Content: A table with columns for Asset Name, Ticker, Current Price, and Daily Change. Each row represents an asset like Bitcoin or Apple stock.
Buttons: At the top of the panel, include “Add Asset” and “Remove Asset” buttons. These should be prominent and colored in a way that stands out (e.g., a green button for adding and a red button for removing).
Sidebar/Modal: When clicking on an asset, a sidebar or modal appears from the right, showing detailed information such as historical data, charts, and recent trades.
Trade Logging Section (Wizard-Based):

Location: Center-right of the screen, occupying the remaining two-thirds of the width.
Step 1 - Asset Selection: A dropdown menu to select the asset. Below it, a field to enter the current price.
Step 2 - Confluence Indicators: Three dropdowns arranged vertically, allowing the selection of Trend, RSI, Moving Averages, and MACD. Each dropdown will be labeled and have a brief description.
Step 3 - Log Trade Details: Fields for Entry Price, Exit Price, Stop Loss, and a Notes section.
Step 4 - Review & Confirm: A summary of all entered information with a “Confirm” button at the bottom.
Design: Each step should be clearly separated, possibly using a breadcrumb trail at the top to show progress.
Footer:

Position: At the bottom of the screen, spanning the full width.
Content: A status bar displaying real-time information like server status, market open/close status, and API connection status.
2. Backtesting Screen
Configuration Panel:

Location: The left side of the screen.
Components: Dropdown for selecting assets, date range picker, and sliders or input fields for strategy parameters (e.g., moving averages, RSI thresholds).
Run Button: A large, prominent button labeled “Run Backtest” at the bottom of the panel.
Results Panel:

Location: The right side of the screen.
Summary: A box at the top displaying key metrics like total profit/loss, win/loss ratio, and average trade return.
Detailed Report: Below the summary, display a table or chart showing individual trades, with export buttons (PDF, CSV) at the top right.
3. Reports Section
Filters Panel:

Location: At the top of the screen.
Components: Date range filter, asset filter (checkboxes or dropdowns), and a report type dropdown.
Generate Button: A prominent button labeled “Generate Report” at the bottom of the filters panel.
Report Display Area:

Location: Below the filters panel.
Content: Visualizations (charts) on the left side and a detailed table on the right.
Export/Print Options: Buttons at the top right corner of the report display area.
4. Asset Management Screen
Asset Overview:

Location: The main area of the screen.
Content: A comprehensive list of assets displayed in a table format, with sorting options at the top of each column.
Add/Remove Buttons: Above the table, with a search bar to quickly find assets.
Asset Details Panel:

Location: A right-side panel that appears when an asset is clicked.
Content: Detailed information about the selected asset, including historical performance, key metrics, and a price chart. Buttons for “Add to Watchlist” or “Run Backtest” should be prominent.
5. Settings Screen
General Settings:

Location: The left side of the screen.
Components:
Theme Selection: A toggle or dropdown to switch between light/dark modes.
Notification Preferences: Checkboxes or toggles to enable/disable notifications for different events (e.g., trade execution, price alerts).
API Integration: Fields to manage API keys and data sources.
User Profile Section:

Location: The right side of the screen.
Content: Forms to update user details (name, email, password) and security settings (two-factor authentication, etc.).
Design Considerations
Color Scheme: Use a professional palette with shades of blue, gray, and white. Important buttons like “Run Backtest” or “Add Asset” should be in a contrasting color like green or orange.
Typography: Use clean, modern fonts like Roboto or Montserrat, with larger sizes for headings and smaller, readable sizes for body text.
Spacing: Ensure ample spacing between elements to avoid clutter and enhance readability.
Icons: Utilize modern, simple icons for buttons and actions to make the UI more intuitive.
By sketching out each of these components, you'll be able to create a well-structured, user-friendly UI that meets your trading application's needs. If you have access to tools like Figma or Sketch, they can help bring these sketches to life in a digital format.
